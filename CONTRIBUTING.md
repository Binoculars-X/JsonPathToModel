> - Mention the project at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues

We always welcome bug reports, coding proposals and overall feedback. 

**Finding Existing Issues**

Before filing a new issue, please search our open issues to check if it already exists.

If you do find an existing issue, please include your own feedback in the discussion. Do consider upvoting (üëç reaction) the original post, as this helps us prioritize popular issues in our backlog.

**Contributing Changes**
Project maintainers will merge changes that improve the product significantly.

**DOs and DON'Ts**

***Please do:***

- DO follow our coding style (C# code-specific).
- DO give priority to the current style of the project or file you're changing even if it diverges from the general guidelines.
- DO include tests when adding new features. When fixing bugs, start with adding a test that highlights how the current behavior is broken.
- DO keep the discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes up it's often better to create new issue than to side track the discussion.
- DO clearly state on an issue that you are going to take on implementing it.
- DO blog and tweet (or whatever) about your contributions, frequently!

***Please do not:***

- DON'T make PRs for style changes.
- DON'T surprise us with big pull requests. Instead, file an issue and start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time.
- DON'T commit code that you didn't write. If you find code that you think is a good fit to add to the .NET runtime, file an issue and start a discussion before proceeding.
- DON'T submit PRs that alter licensing related files or headers. If you believe there's a problem with them, file an issue and we'll be happy to discuss it.
- DON'T add API additions without filing an issue and discussing with us first. See API Review Process.
